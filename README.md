**`Backend Developer`**

I am a programming student at the beginning of my learning journey. I am focused on learning programming logic and backend development with Java. I enjoy solving problems and I am always trying to better understand how code works. I am interested in building a career in the technology area, especially in the banking sector in the future. Currently, I am dedicated to courses, small projects, and logic exercises to improve my skills.
